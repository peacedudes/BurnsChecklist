#  Burn's Depression Checklist

This is a simple single view iOS application that tallies and graphs the results of answering checklist of symptoms of depression over time, based on a list created by David D. Burns M.D.

The checklist may contain copyrighted material by Dr. Burns, and should not be shared or published without first obtaining specific permission.  It is included here as an example for personal use.

The app should compile and run on MacOS Sonoma 14 or iOS 16 without.  It will produce a historical chart of scores over time after three datat points have been collected (on separate dates).
